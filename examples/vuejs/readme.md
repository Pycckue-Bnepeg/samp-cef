# VueJS for SAMP-CEF by ZOTTCE

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g vue-cli
```
```bash
vue init webpack [your-project-name]
```

## Usage

When you use "cef.on", "cef.on" or "cef.off", VueJS cancel building.

You can resolve error by creating "cef" folder in "node_modules" directory.

Then, create index.js in this folder, now import cef to your code.

```js
import cef from 'cef';
```

**Enjoy**.
